Smoke also keeps your baby from getting nourishment and raises the risk of stillbirth or premature birth. Don\\'t drink alcohol. There is no known safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink while pregnant. Alcohol can cause life-long physical and behavioral problems in children, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Don\\'t use illegal drugs. Using illegal drugs may cause underweight babies, birth defects or withdrawal symptoms after birth.

These injuries can affect the entire leg, or just the foot, ankle, knee, or hip. Certain diseases also lead to leg problems.
